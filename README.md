🗄 Database Setup

1️⃣ Create Database and Tables

Run the following SQL commands in MySQL:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hospital_db;
USE hospital_db;

CREATE TABLE patients (
  patient_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  gender VARCHAR(10),
  phone VARCHAR(15),
  address VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  doctor_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  specialization VARCHAR(100),
  notes TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE beds (
  bed_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  ward VARCHAR(50),
  bed_number VARCHAR(10),
  status VARCHAR(20),
  patient_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(patient_id)
);

CREATE TABLE appointments (
  appointment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  patient_id INT,
  doctor_id INT,
  appointment_date DATE,
  time_slot VARCHAR(10),
  status VARCHAR(20),
  FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(patient_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(doctor_id)
);
